Checkpoint Objective
Write a Python program for a binary search.
Test Data: 

binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 6) -> False
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 5) -> True
     2. Write a Python program to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'.

Test Data: 

(power(3,4) -> 81
       3. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.

Sample Data: [29,13,22,37,52,49,46,71,56]

Expected result: [13, 22, 29, 37, 42, 46, 49, 56, 71]

      4. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the merge sort algorithm.

Sample Data: [29,13,22,37,52,49,46,71,56]

Expected result: [13, 22, 29, 37, 42, 46, 49, 56, 71]

       5. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the quick sort algorithm.

Sample Data: [29,13,22,37,52,49,46,71,56]

Expected result: [13, 22, 29, 37, 42, 46, 49, 56, 71]
